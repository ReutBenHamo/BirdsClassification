## Bird Species Classification Using CNN
This assignment, part of the Deep Learning workshop at Ben Gurion University, focuses on classifying bird species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Tasks include exploring the "100 Bird Species" dataset from Kaggle, assessing data dimensionality, sample contents, balance, and benchmark results. Students will construct neural network graphs, perform KFold cross-validation, analyze results, suggest improvements, implement inference-time augmentation, add new image categories and evaluate model architectures.
