## Bird Species Classification Using CNN
This assignment involves an exploratory data analysis of the "100 Bird Species" dataset from Kaggle. 
Tasks include assessing data dimensionality, sample contents, balance, benchmark results, and presenting sample images. 
Students will construct neural network graphs, perform KFold cross-validation, analyze results,suggest improvements, implement inference-time augmentation, add new image categories, evaluate model architectures, and write a research report.
